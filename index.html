            <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
              <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best* and the most grueling *time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers working as a software Enginer at a VR startup."</p>

          <h4>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h4>
            <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>

          <h5>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h5>
            <p>"Before joining bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
